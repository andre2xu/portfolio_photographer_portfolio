# Photographer Portfolio
Demo: [https://andre2xu.github.io/portfolio_photographer_portfolio/](https://andre2xu.github.io/portfolio_photographer_portfolio/)

This is a fake website I created with React to showcase my frontend knowledge. The context behind it is that it's owned by a photographer named Dan. He has a business called ***Protos*** which offers professional photography services to a variety of clients. This website acts as a portfolio for his skills as well as a platform for potential customers to get in touch with him.
